# Run cr

I want you to do a thorough review of my code changes

Run the following to get the changes (if you don't already have a diff)

`git diff main | awk '/diff --git/{p=!/package-lock.json|yarn.lock/} p{print}'`

Consider:
1. Code quality and adherence to best practices
2. Potential bugs or edge cases
3. Performance optimizations
4. Readability and maintainability
5. Any security concerns

Suggest improvements and explain your reasoning for each suggestion.

Feel free to use the other cursor rules for more specific best practices (TypeScript, React, Storybook, Tests, etc)
