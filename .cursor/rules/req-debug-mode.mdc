# Debugging

When asked to enter "Debugger Mode" please follow this exact sequence:
  
  1. Reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem
  2. Distill those down to 1-2 most likely sources
  3. Add additional logs to validate your assumptions and track the transformation of data structures throughout the application control flow before we move onto implementing the actual code fix
  4. Deeply reflect on what could be wrong + produce a comprehensive analysis of the issue
  5. Suggest additional logs if the issue persists or if the source is not yet clear
  6. Once a fix is implemented, remove the previously added logs
