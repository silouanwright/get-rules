# Run cr

We're going to prepare to pack files to do a code review in another AI.

If we've talked at length, tell me to add the conversation from specstory first, otherwise, do not mention this at all.

Run the following to get the changes (if you don't already have a diff)

`git diff main | awk '/diff --git/{p=!/package-lock.json|yarn.lock/} p{print}'`

With the conversation and the diff, it may be beneficial to pack additional files, because a diff may not be enough. 

After you pack those files I want tou to copy the following to my clipboard:

1. This conversation (only if I added the conversation from specstory)
2. The diff
3. The packed filed.
4. The code review considerations below

## Code review Considerations

Consider:
1. Code quality and adherence to best practices
2. Potential bugs or edge cases
3. Performance optimizations
4. Readability and maintainability
5. Any security concerns

Suggest improvements and explain your reasoning for each suggestion.

## additional notes

Feel free to use the other cursor rules for more specific best practices (TypeScript, React, Storybook, Tests, etc)
