I want you to create a changeset markdown file for me.

First, run a git diff: `git diff main | awk '/diff --git/{p=!/package-lock.json|yarn.lock/} p{print}'`

Based on the changes of this diff, create a changeset file

- It goes in the `.changeset/` folder which already exists
- The file name abides by the following rules
  - It's naming should be 3 words separated by hyphens 
	  -	First word is an adjective (e.g., "itchy")
	  -	Second word is a noun (e.g., "eyes")
	  -	Third word is a verb (e.g., "design")
  - The words are chosen generically and randomly (from adjectives, nouns, and verbs)
  - For instance: `.changeset/tasty-moons-destroy.md`
- Here is an example of a changeset

```
---
'@stitch-fix/knit': patch
---

fix(knit:Banner): add new color for Banner Component
```

- Determine based on the diff I give you, which packages should be bumped
- The package is based on the directory of the change that is inside `src/packages`. `mode-react`, `knit`, etc
- Determine based on the nature of the changes (and SEMVER), whether those packages are major, minor, or patch bumps
- The description should use the conventional commit format

Here are multiple examples

  ```
  fix(mode-react:SaveBookmark): Remove duplicate accessibility label
  ```
  ```
  fix(knit): Rebrand - fix primary nav hide on scroll
  ```
  ```
  feat!: Migrate mode-react into the monorepo, also:

  - Removes styleName prop for className
  - Removed all KFI dependencies and references
  - Improved e2e test flakyness
  - Removed deprecated sass method `str-slice` for `string.slice`
  - Bump @svg/core from v5 -> v8 for SVG Icons and updated the SVG Template
  ```
